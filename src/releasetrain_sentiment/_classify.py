"""Trainable TPS/GDS classifier.

Reviewer #9 reports that Multinomial Naive Bayes "achieves the best
balance in identifying the minority TPS class" among the paper's own
compared models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, RoBERTa). This module
ships that same model family as a trainable scikit-learn pipeline, kept
separate from baseline_vader.py's keyword-override reconstruction, so the
TPS/GDS label a caller actually uses for decisions never depends on the
keyword-contamination policy Reviewer #7 flagged.

No pretrained model ships with this package: the original 542-post gold
dataset (TPSGDS-542) was not available when this package was built. Train
on your own labeled data with train_classifier(), then persist the result
with save_classifier() for reuse.

Requires the "classify" extra: pip install releasetrain-sentiment[classify]
